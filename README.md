# Telegram Taxi Bot

A Telegram bot that connects riders with nearby drivers in real time. Drivers register, share their live location, and manage their availability. Riders share their location and instantly see a sorted list of nearby drivers with direct call and WhatsApp links — no in-app booking, no payment processing.

---

## Project Overview

**Who it's for:** Independent taxi/tuk/van/SUV drivers and their riders in a local market.

**How it works:**
- Drivers register once, wait for admin approval, then go online by sharing their live location
- Riders share their location and see the nearest available drivers sorted by distance
- Contact happens directly via phone or WhatsApp — the bot is a discovery layer only

**V1 scope:** Registration, geo search, referral tracking, admin approval/broadcast. No booking flow, no payments, no ratings.

**Key technical decisions:**

| Choice | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **grammy.js** | Native `edited_message` support for live location updates; clean middleware pattern; conversations plugin for multi-step registration |
| **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** | `ST_DWithin` + GIST spatial index makes the "find nearby" query O(log n); geodesic accuracy within metres |
| **Long polling** | Simple, no webhook infrastructure needed for V1 scale |
| **Docker Compose** | Single command spins up PostgreSQL/PostGIS + bot + Adminer; identical across dev and prod |

## How It Works

### For Drivers

**First time — Registration**

1. Open the bot and send `/start`
2. Tap **🚗 I am a Driver**
3. The bot walks you through registration step by step:
   - Your full name
   - Phone number with country code (e.g. `+94771234567`)
   - Vehicle type (Car / Tuk / Van / SUV)
   - Number of seats
   - Vehicle plate number
4. After registration you will see: *"Your profile is pending admin approval."*
5. Once an admin approves you, you receive a notification and can go online

**Daily use — Going online**

1. Tap **🟢 Go Online**
2. The bot asks you to share your live location
3. In the Telegram mobile app: tap the 📎 attachment icon → **Location** → **Share Live Location** → select duration (up to 8 hours)
4. You are now visible to riders — Telegram updates your location automatically every ~30 seconds in the background

**Status buttons**

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 Go Online | Makes you visible to riders — requires live location share |
| 🟡 Busy | Hides you from rider search while you are on a trip |
| 🔴 Go Offline | Hides you from rider search entirely |
| 👤 My Profile | Shows your registration details, current status, and referral count |
| 🔗 Invite Drivers | Gives you a personal invite link to share with other drivers |

**Location expiry**

- Your live location lasts up to 8 hours (Telegram limit)
- You receive a reminder notification ~1 hour before it expires
- If it expires without renewal, your status is automatically set to Offline and you are notified
- To become visible again, tap **🟢 Go Online** and re-share your live location

**Invite other drivers**

- Tap **🔗 Invite Drivers** to get your personal referral link
- Share the link with other drivers — when they register via your link, they are counted as your referral
- View your referral count anytime in **👤 My Profile**

---

### For Riders

No registration required. Just start the bot and search.

1. Send `/start` and tap **🙋 I am a Rider**
2. Tap **🔍 Find Drivers**
3. Tap **📍 Share My Location** — a one-tap location button in the keyboard
4. You instantly see the nearest available drivers sorted by distance:

```
Drivers near you (All):

1. Sunil – 0.6 km
   🚗 Car | Seats: 4
   📞 Call | 💬 WhatsApp

2. Kasun – 1.2 km
   🛺 Tuk | Seats: 3
   📞 Call | 💬 WhatsApp
```

5. Tap **📞 Call** or **💬 WhatsApp** to contact the driver directly
6. Use the filter buttons to narrow by vehicle type: **All · Car · Tuk · Van · SUV** — filtering re-uses your shared location, no need to share it again

**Important:** The bot shows only drivers who are currently online and have shared their live location recently. If no drivers appear, try again in a few minutes.

---

### For Admins

Your Telegram user ID must be listed in the `ADMIN_IDS` environment variable. All commands are sent directly in your bot chat — they are silently blocked for non-admin users.

**Typical workflow**

```
New driver registers
       │
       ▼
/admin_drivers          ← see the new driver and their ID
       │
       ▼
/approve <id>           ← driver is notified and can go online
       │
       ▼
(monitor ongoing)
       │
  ┌────┴────┐
  ▼         ▼
/disable   /enable      ← if a driver causes issues or returns
```

**Command reference**

---

#### `/admin_help`
Lists all available admin commands in the chat. Use this as a quick reference at any time.

---

#### `/admin_drivers`
Shows all registered drivers with their current state.

```
Registered Drivers (3)

[1] Sunil | CAR | available | ✅
[2] Kasun | TUK | offline   | ✅
[3] Priya | VAN | offline   | ⏳
```

Column meanings:
- `[id]` — the ID used in all other commands
- `available / busy / offline` — current status
- `✅` — approved and enabled
- `⏳` — registered but not yet approved
- `🚫` — disabled

---

#### `/approve <id>`

Approves a pending driver. They receive an instant notification and can immediately tap **🟢 Go Online**.

```
/approve 3
```

> Use `/admin_drivers` first to get the correct ID.

---

#### `/disable <id>`

Disables a driver. Their status is immediately set to Offline and they disappear from all rider searches. The driver receives a notification. Use this for drivers who violate rules or need to be suspended.

```
/disable 2
```

A disabled driver cannot go online until re-enabled. They see *"Your account has been disabled"* when they try.

---

#### `/enable <id>`

Re-enables a previously disabled driver. They receive a notification and can go online again.

```
/enable 2
```

---

#### `/broadcast <message>`

Sends a message to every registered driver. Useful for announcements, rule reminders, or service updates. The bot reports how many messages were delivered and how many failed (e.g. drivers who have blocked the bot).

```
/broadcast Tomorrow the service will be unavailable from 2–4pm for maintenance.
```

```
📢 Broadcast complete.
Delivered: 12 | Failed: 1
```

---

## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites

- Docker Compose running (`docker compose up -d`)
- At least one Telegram account for the admin/driver role
- A second Telegram account (or ask a friend) for the rider role
- Adminer open at `http://localhost:8080` for database verification

---

### Test Seed Data

To test rider search without needing real drivers at real GPS coordinates, insert mock drivers directly into the database. Open Adminer → **SQL command** tab and run:

```sql
INSERT INTO drivers (
  telegram_id, name, phone, vehicle_type, seats, vehicle_number,
  status, location, location_updated_at, location_share_started_at,
  is_approved, is_enabled, referral_code
) VALUES
  -- ~0 km — Rastatt city centre
  (1000000001, 'Sunil Perera',       '+94711000001', 'car', 4, 'CAB-1001',
   'available',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2030, 48.8578)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   true, true, 'seed0001'),

  -- ~0.6 km away
  (1000000002, 'Kasun Silva',        '+94711000002', 'tuk', 3, 'TUK-2002',
   'available',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2100, 48.8610)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   true, true, 'seed0002'),

  -- ~1.5 km away
  (1000000003, 'Priya Fernando',     '+94711000003', 'van', 6, 'VAN-3003',
   'available',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2200, 48.8650)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   true, true, 'seed0003'),

  -- ~3.2 km away
  (1000000004, 'Nimal Jayawardena',  '+94711000004', 'suv', 5, 'SUV-4004',
   'available',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2400, 48.8720)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   true, true, 'seed0004'),

  -- ~5.8 km away — busy, must NOT appear in search
  (1000000005, 'Roshan de Mel',      '+94711000005', 'car', 4, 'CAB-5005',
   'busy',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2700, 48.8800)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   true, true, 'seed0005'),

  -- Unapproved — must NOT appear in search
  (1000000006, 'Pending Driver',     '+94711000006', 'car', 4, 'CAB-6006',
   'available',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2040, 48.8585)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   false, true, 'seed0006'),

  -- Offline — must NOT appear in search
  (1000000007, 'Offline Driver',     '+94711000007', 'tuk', 2, 'TUK-7007',
   'offline',
   ST_MakePoint(8.2050, 48.8590)::geography, NOW(), NOW(),
   true, true, 'seed0007')
ON CONFLICT (telegram_id) DO NOTHING;
```

> The coordinates above are centred around Rastatt, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. To use your own area, replace `8.2030, 48.8578` with your `longitude, latitude` and adjust the offsets for the other drivers.

**To keep seed data fresh** (prevent expiry):
```sql
UPDATE drivers
SET location_updated_at = NOW(), location_share_started_at = NOW()
WHERE telegram_id BETWEEN 1000000001 AND 1000000007;
```

**To remove seed data:**
```sql
DELETE FROM drivers WHERE telegram_id BETWEEN 1000000001 AND 1000000007;
```

---

### Stage 1 — Basic Bot Setup

1. Send `/start` to the bot
2. ✅ Two buttons appear: **🚗 I am a Driver** and **🙋 I am a Rider**
3. Tap **I am a Rider** → ✅ rider menu with **🔍 Find Drivers** appears
4. Send `/start` again, tap **I am a Driver** → ✅ registration flow begins (name prompt)

**DB check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM riders;
-- One row should appear after tapping "I am a Rider"
```

---

### Stage 2 — Driver Registration & Status

Complete the registration flow:
- Name: `Test Driver`
- Phone: `+94771234567`
- Vehicle: `Car`
- Seats: `4`
- Plate: `TEST-001`

✅ Bot confirms: *"Your profile is pending admin approval."*

**Approve yourself (you are the admin):**
```
/admin_drivers     ← note your driver ID (e.g. 1)
/approve 1
```
✅ You receive: *"Your account has been approved!"*

**Test status buttons:**
1. Tap **🟢 Go Online** → bot asks to share live location
2. Share live location via 📎 → Location → Share Live Location
3. ✅ Bot confirms: *"Location received! You are now visible to riders."*
4. Tap **🟡 Busy** → ✅ status changes
5. Tap **🔴 Go Offline** → ✅ status changes

**DB check:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, is_approved,
       ST_AsText(location::geometry) AS coords,
       location_updated_at
FROM drivers WHERE id = 1;
-- coords should be populated, location_updated_at should be recent
```

---

### Stage 3 — Rider Search

With seed data inserted (or a real driver online), switch to your rider account:

1. Tap **🔍 Find Drivers**
2. Tap **📍 Share My Location** (keyboard button)
3. ✅ Results appear immediately, sorted by distance, with **All · Car · Tuk · Van · SUV** filter buttons

**Verify correctness:**
- Sunil (0.4 km) appears before Kasun (1.1 km) — ✅ sorted ascending
- Roshan (busy) does NOT appear — ✅ only `available` shown
- Pending Driver does NOT appear — ✅ unapproved excluded
- Offline Driver does NOT appear — ✅ offline excluded

**Test vehicle filter:**
- Tap **🛺 Tuk** → ✅ only Kasun Silva shown
- Tap **All** → ✅ all available drivers shown again (no new location share needed)

**DB check:**
```sql
-- Manually verify distance calculation for your location
SELECT name,
       ROUND(ST_Distance(
         location,
         ST_MakePoint(8.2030, 48.8578)::geography  -- replace with your coords
       )::numeric / 1000, 2) AS distance_km
FROM drivers
WHERE status = 'available' AND is_approved = true AND is_enabled = true
ORDER BY distance_km;
```

---

### Stage 4 — Referral System

1. As a driver, tap **🔗 Invite Drivers** → copy the invite link
2. Open the link in a browser or send to a second Telegram account
3. The second account goes through registration
4. ✅ After the second driver registers, tap **👤 My Profile** → referral count shows `1`

**DB check:**
```sql
SELECT
  r.referrer_driver_id,
  d1.name AS referrer,
  d2.name AS referred
FROM referrals r
JOIN drivers d1 ON d1.id = r.referrer_driver_id
JOIN drivers d2 ON d2.id = r.referred_driver_id;
```

---

### Stage 5 — Admin Commands

Run all commands from your admin account:

| Command | Expected result |
|---------|----------------|
| `/admin_help` | Lists all 6 commands |
| `/admin_drivers` | Shows all registered drivers with IDs and status |
| `/approve 1` | Driver notified, can go online |
| `/disable 1` | Driver set offline, hidden from search, notified |
| `/enable 1` | Driver re-enabled, notified |
| `/broadcast Hello!` | All drivers receive "Hello!", bot reports delivered/failed count |

**Verify disable hides driver from search:**
1. `/disable 1`
2. As rider, share location → driver should NOT appear in results
3. `/enable 1` → driver reappears after going online again

---

### Stage 6 — Profile Editing

1. As a driver, tap **✏️ Edit Profile**
2. ✅ Inline keyboard shows: Name · Phone · Vehicle Type · Seats · Plate Number
3. Tap **Seats** → enter `2` → ✅ updated
4. Tap **👤 My Profile** → ✅ seats now shows `2`

**DB check:**
```sql
SELECT name, phone, vehicle_type, seats, vehicle_number FROM drivers WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### Stage 7 — Location Expiry (Background Jobs)

The background job runs every 15 minutes. To test it immediately, manually expire a driver's location:

```sql
-- Simulate expired location
UPDATE drivers
SET location_updated_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
WHERE id = 1;
```

Then as a rider, search for drivers → ✅ the driver no longer appears.

Wait up to 15 minutes (or restart the bot to trigger the first job run sooner) → ✅ driver receives *"Your live location has expired"* notification and status is set to `offline`.

To test the reminder notification, simulate being 7 hours into a live location share:
```sql
UPDATE drivers
SET location_share_started_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '7 hours'
WHERE id = 1;
```
Wait up to 15 minutes → ✅ driver receives the 1-hour warning.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd telegram-drivers-bot
npm install
```

### 2. Create your Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram and message `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the bot token

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_token_from_botfather
ADMIN_IDS=your_telegram_user_id
```

> **Tip:** To find your Telegram user ID, message `@userinfobot` on Telegram.

---

## Deployment with Docker Compose

### Development (with Adminer)

Starts PostgreSQL/PostGIS, the bot, and Adminer (database admin UI at `http://localhost:8080`).

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Verify everything is running:**

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f bot
```

**Adminer login** — open `http://localhost:8080`:
- System: `PostgreSQL`
- Server: `db`
- Username: `taxibot`
- Password: value of `DB_PASSWORD` in your `.env` (default: `taxibot_dev_password`)
- Database: `taxi_bot`

### Production

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

The production compose file excludes Adminer and does not expose the database port.

### Stopping

```bash
docker compose down          # stop containers, keep data
docker compose down -v       # stop containers and delete database volume
```

### Rebuilding after code changes

```bash
docker compose up -d --build bot
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | — | Telegram bot token from @BotFather |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | — | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `ADMIN_IDS` | Yes | — | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs for admin access |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Docker only | `taxibot_dev_password` | PostgreSQL password used in docker-compose |
| `SEARCH_RADIUS_KM` | No | `10` | Maximum search radius for riders (km) |
| `MAX_RESULTS` | No | `10` | Maximum drivers shown per search |
| `LOCATION_EXPIRY_HOURS` | No | `1` | Exclude drivers with no location update in N hours |

---

## Admin Commands

Send these from your Telegram account (your ID must be in `ADMIN_IDS`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/admin_help` | List all admin commands |
| `/admin_drivers` | List all registered drivers with status and approval state |
| `/approve <id>` | Approve a driver — they are notified and can go online |
| `/disable <id>` | Disable a driver — set offline, hidden from search |
| `/enable <id>` | Re-enable a previously disabled driver |
| `/broadcast <message>` | Send a message to all registered drivers |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding**
Check the token is correct and the container is running:
```bash
docker compose logs bot
```

**No drivers found in search**
Drivers must be: approved (`/approve <id>`), have status `available` (Go Online tapped), and have shared live location within the last `LOCATION_EXPIRY_HOURS` hour(s).

**Migration fails on startup**
Ensure PostGIS is available. With Docker Compose this is automatic — the bot waits for the `db` container to be healthy before starting.

**Live location not updating**
Drivers must share **live** location (not a static pin). In the Telegram mobile app: tap the 📎 attachment icon → Location → Share Live Location → select duration.
